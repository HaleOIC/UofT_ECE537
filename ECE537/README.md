## README

This folder has contained a lab which comes from the `ECE537`, acutally I do not know his school and course resources, but his `Pluto` elegent UI attracts me a lot, and its labs' handout is very skillful. Due to the poor inner-class resources, so I wanna do it for better undestanding.

It has contained five labs`1-5`, while `Julia` is a new language for me, so I add a `Lab0` into the folder which contains some basic programmas in `Julia`.

The framework of the labs are:

- [x] `lab0`: basic introduction to `Julia` and `Pluto`
- [ ] `lab1`: `Univariate Random varables` and `Independence of Discrete random variables`
- [ ] `lab2`: `Bivariate Gaussian Distributions` and `empirical verificaiton of the Law of Large Numbers and Central limit Theorem`
- [ ] `lab3`: `Random Walk Process`  and `Poisson Random process`
- [ ] `lab4`: `Generate Low-pass random process` and `Power Spectral density`
- [ ] `lab5`: `autoregressive filter` and `coefficient estimation`

when using the `Pluto` as notebook, I find it is really interestring and interactive, you can learn a lot when you install `Pluto` and check the `Getting started`.
